# Data Science Practical
This repository contains the project files submitted as part of my college Data Science practical assignment.  
The work focuses on basic data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python.

## Project Overview
The objective of this practical is to understand how raw data can be processed, cleaned, and visualized to extract useful insights.

## Dataset
- `crime_data.csv` – original dataset used for analysis  
- `cleaned_crime_data.csv` – cleaned version of the dataset after preprocessing  

## Files Description
- `crime_data_cleaning.py` – script for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset  
- `crime_data_visualization.py` – script for generating visualizations  
- `requirements.txt` – list of Python dependencies  

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Purpose
This project was developed strictly for **academic and practical learning purposes** as part of the Data Science curriculum.
